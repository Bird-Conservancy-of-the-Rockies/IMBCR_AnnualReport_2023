<p>Field technicians completed all planned surveys (100%) in 2023. Technicians conducted 151 point counts within the 11 surveyed grid cells between June 11 and July 12. They detected 43 bird species, including 7 priority species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated densities and population sizes for 102 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 6 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust density estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 11 species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated the proportion of 1 km² grid cells occupied (Ψ, Psi) throughout Pinedale Field Office for 102 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 6 of which are priority species.
