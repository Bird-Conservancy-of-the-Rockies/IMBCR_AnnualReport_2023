    "text": "Bird Conservancy of the Rockies (Bird Conservancy), in conjunction with our partners, conducted the 16th consecutive year of landbird monitoring for the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program.\nIMBCR is based on a spatially balanced sampling design which provides inference to avian populations at various scales, from local management units to entire states or Bird Conservation Regions, facilitating conservation at local and national levels. The nested design also provides a consistent and flexible framework for understanding and comparing the status and annual changes of bird populations with local and regional context.\nCollaboration across organizations and spatial scales increases sample sizes and improves the accuracy and precision of population estimates. Analyzing the data collectively allows us to estimate detection probabilities for species that would otherwise have insufficient numbers of detections at local scales.\nFor these reasons, the IMBCR program is well-positioned to address conservation and management needs for a wide range of stakeholders, encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to bird conservation that combines monitoring, research, and management.\nIn 2023, the IMBCR program’s area of inference encompassed four entire states (Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming) and portions of 11 additional states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, and South Dakota). We surveyed across US Forest Service (USFS) Regions 1, 2, and 4 and in portions of Region 3; all of the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17), and portions of nine other BCRs: Great Basin (9), Northern Rockies (10), Prairie Potholes (11), Sierra Nevada (15), Southern Rockies/Colorado Plateau (16), Shortgrass Prairie (18), Central Mixed Grass Prairie (19), Sonoran and Mojave Deserts (33), and Sierra Madre Occidental (34).\nObservers conducted 16,902 point counts within 1,513 sampling units between April 30 and July 23, 2023. They detected 201,490 individual birds representing 353 species. This report summarizes the results of the 2023 field season.\nLong-term, rigorous monitoring provides valuable information on population status and allows managers and researchers to ask additional questions. We provide a few examples demonstrating the use of IMBCR data to address specific management or conservation questions using either the annual monitoring effort we conduct each year or targeted monitoring in an overlay project.",

    "text": "Monitoring is an essential component of wildlife management and conservation science (Marsh & Trenham, 2008; Witmer, 2005). Common goals of population monitoring are to estimate the population status of target species and to detect changes in populations over time (Sauer & Knutson, 2008; Thompson, White, & Gowan, 1998). In addition to providing basic information on species distributions, effective monitoring programs can identify species that are at-risk because of small or declining populations (Dreitz, Lukacs, & Knopf, 2006); provide an understanding of how management actions affect populations (Alexander, Stephens, Geupel, & Will, 2008; Lyons, Runge, Laskowski, & Kendall, 2008); and evaluate population responses to landscape alteration and climate change (Baron et al., 2008; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009).\nWhile monitoring at local scales remains critical, there is an increasing need to monitor the consequences of environmental change over large spatial and temporal scales and address questions much larger than those that can be answered within individual management units (Dreitz, Stinson, Hahn, Tack, & Lukacs, 2017; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009). Reconciling disparities between the geographic scale of management actions and the scale of ecological and species-specific responses is a persistent challenge for natural resource management agencies (Ruggiero, Hayward, & Squires, 1994). Population monitoring of eco-regional landscapes provides an important context for evaluating population change at local and regional scales, with the potential to identify causal factors and management actions for species recovery (Manley, Schlesinger, Roth, & Van Horne, 2005; Sauer & Knutson, 2008).\nBefore monitoring can be used by land managers to guide conservation efforts, sound program designs and analytical methods are necessary to produce unbiased population estimates (Sauer & Knutson, 2008). At the most fundamental level, reliable knowledge about the status of avian populations requires accounting for spatial variation and incomplete detection of the target species (Pollock et al., 2002; Rosenstock, Anderson, Giesen, Leukering, & Carter, 2002; Thompson, 2002). Addressing spatial variation entails the use of probabilistic sampling designs, which allows population estimates to be extended over the entire area of interest (Thompson et al., 1998). Accounting for incomplete detection involves the use of appropriate sampling and analytical methods to address the fact that few, if any, species are so conspicuous that they are detected with certainty when present during a survey. Accounting for these two sources of variation ensures that observed trends reflect true population changes rather than artifacts of the sampling and observation processes (Pollock et al., 2002; Thompson, 2002).\nThe apparent large-scale declines of avian populations and the loss, fragmentation and degradation of native habitats highlight the need for extensive and rigorous landbird monitoring programs (Rich et al., 2004; US North American Bird Conservation Initiative Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). The US North American Bird Conservation Initiative’s (NABCI) “Opportunities for Improving Avian Monitoring” (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007) provided goals for avian monitoring programs including:\n\nGoal 1: Fully integrate monitoring into bird management and conservation practices and ensure that monitoring is aligned with management and conservation priorities.\nGoal 2: Coordinate monitoring programs among organizations and integrate them across spatial scales to solve conservation or management problems effectively.\nGoal 3: Increase the value of monitoring information by improving statistical design.\nGoal 4: Maintain bird population monitoring data in modern data management systems. Recognize legal, institutional, proprietary, and other constraints while still providing greater availability of raw data, associated metadata, and summary data for bird monitoring programs.\n\nWith the NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee (2007) guidelines in mind, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and partners initiated a broad-scale collaborative bird monitoring program in 2008 entitled “Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions” (IMBCR) (Blakesley & Hanni, 2009). See Appendix B: IMBCR Program and Stratification History for a complete history of this program. The monitoring objectives of the IMBCR partnership are to:\n\nProvide robust density, population and occupancy estimates that account for incomplete detection and are comparable at different geographic extents;\nProvide long-term status and trend data for all regularly occurring breeding landbird species throughout the study area;\nProvide a design framework to spatially integrate existing bird monitoring efforts in the region to provide better information on distribution and abundance of breeding landbirds, especially for high priority species;\nProvide basic habitat association data for most bird species to address habitat management issues;\nMaintain a high-quality database that effectively merges records between regional data nodes and is accessible to all of our collaborators as well as to the public over the internet, in the form of raw and summarized data; and\nGenerate decision support tools that help guide conservation efforts and provide a better measure of conservation success.\n\nThe IMBCR design includes Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) as sampling frames (Figure 5.1), stratified by land ownership inside each BCR (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). BCRs provide a spatially consistent framework for bird conservation in North America. Each BCR represents a distinct ecological region with similar bird communities, vegetation types, and resource management interests (NABCI, 2000). Population monitoring within BCRs is implemented with a flexible hierarchical framework of nested units, where information on bird populations can be partitioned into smaller units for small-scale conservation planning, or aggregated to support large-scale conservation efforts. By focusing on scales relevant to management and conservation, information obtained from monitoring in BCRs can be integrated into research and management objectives at various scales applicable to managers (Pavlacky et al., 2017; Ruth et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Bird Conservation Regions throughout North America, excluding Hawaii.",

    "text": "6.2 Sampling Design\n\nSampling Frame and Stratification\nA key feature of the IMBCR design is the ability to estimate bird population parameters at multiple spatial scales, from small management units, such as individual national forests or field offices, to entire states and BCRs. This is accomplished through hierarchical (nested) sampling of smaller within larger units. The fundamental units of the design (and therefore of population estimation) are strata, which are mutually exclusive and together form the programmatic footprint in any given year. Strata-level population estimates can be combined to derive estimates at larger scales for groups of strata (hereafter superstrata). For example, data from each individual national forest stratum in USFS Region 2 are combined to produce Region-wide population estimates; data from each individual stratum in Montana are combined to produce statewide estimates; and data from each individual stratum in BCR 17 are combined to produce BCR-wide estimates.\nWe define strata based on areas to which IMBCR partners wanted to make inferences. Strata contributing to the baseline monitoring effort (hereafter background strata) are nested within the intersection of state and BCR boundaries (e.g., Wyoming-BCR 10). Additionally, we base background strata within the state-BCR sampling frames on fixed attributes, such as land ownership boundaries, elevation zones, major river systems and wilderness/roadless designations. Additional strata defined for particular objectives, such as monitoring within areas subject to management action, are not subject to the same constraints as background strata (hereafter overlay strata).\n\n\nSampling Units\nWe define sampling units as 1 km² cells, each containing 16 evenly spaced sample points, 250 meters apart (Figure 6.2). We define potential sampling units by superimposing a uniform grid of cells over each state in the study area. We then assign each cell to a stratum using ArcGIS version 10.X and higher (Environmental Systems Research Institute, 2017). For all stratifications developed after 2012, we use the United States National Grid (USNG), a nonproprietary alphanumeric referencing system derived from the Military Grid Reference System that was created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Example 1 km² sampling unit in the IMBCR design.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Selection\nWithin each stratum, we use generalized random-tessellation stratification (GRTS), a spatially balanced sampling algorithm, to select sampling units (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). The GRTS design has useful properties with respect to long-term monitoring of birds at large spatial scales including:\n\nSpatially balanced sampling is generally more efficient than simple random sampling of natural resources (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). Incorporating information about spatial autocorrelation in the data can increase precision in density estimates.\nAll sampling units in the sampling frame are ordered, such that any set of consecutively numbered units is a spatially well-balanced sample (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). In the case of fluctuating budgets, IMBCR partners can adjust the sampling effort among years within each stratum while still preserving a random, spatially balanced sampling design.\n\nWe require two sampling units to be surveyed within each stratum, but reliable stratum-level occupancy estimates require larger sample sizes, with a minimum of approximately 8-10 samples per stratum. Additional samples may be required for strata comprising large geographic areas. Because we estimate regional density and occupancy using an area weighted mean, adding more samples to a particular stratum does not bias the overall estimate, it simply increases the precision. After the initial two sampling units were selected, the remaining allocation of sampling effort among strata was based on the priorities of the funding partners.",

    "text": "6.3 Sampling Methods\nIMBCR observers with excellent aural and visual bird-identification skills conducted field work in 2022. Prior to conducting surveys, observers completed an intensive training program to ensure full understanding of the field protocol and review bird and plant identification. Observers were also shadowed by a crew leader at the start of the field season to ensure they understood the protocol and could identify all birds within a region.\nObservers conducted point counts (Buckland et al., 2001) following protocols established by IMBCR partners (Hanni, White, Birek, Van Lanen, & McLaren, 2012). Observers conducted surveys in the morning, beginning one-half hour before sunrise and concluding no later than five hours after sunrise. Observers recorded the start time for every point count conducted. For every bird detected during the six-minute period, observers recorded species, sex, horizontal distance from the observer, minute, type of detection (e.g., call, song, visual), whether the bird was thought to be a migrant, and whether the observer was able to visually identify each record.\nObservers measured distances to each bird using laser rangefinders when possible. When it was not possible, observers estimated the distance by measuring to some object near the bird using a laser rangefinder. In addition to recording all bird species detected in the area during point counts, observers recorded birds flying over but not using the immediate surrounding landscape. Observers also recorded Abert’s squirrel (Sciurus aberti), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and American pika (Ochotona princeps). While observers traveled between points within a sampling unit, they recorded the presence of any species not recorded during a point count. The opportunistic detections of these species are used for distribution purposes only.\nObservers considered all non-independent detections of birds (i.e., flocks or pairs of conspecific birds together in close proximity) as part of a “cluster” rather than as independent observations. Observers recorded the number of birds detected within each cluster along with a letter code to distinguish between multiple clusters.\nAt the start and end of each survey, observers recorded time, ambient temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and wind speed. Observers navigated to each point using hand-held Global Positioning System units. Before beginning each six-minute count, surveyors recorded vegetation data within a 50m radius of the point via ocular estimation. Vegetation data included the dominant habitat type and relative abundance, percent cover and mean height of trees and shrubs by species, grass height, and ground cover. Observers recorded vegetation data quietly to allow birds time to return to their normal habits prior to beginning each count.\nFor more detailed information about survey methods and vegetation data collection protocols, refer to Bird Conservancy’s Field Protocol for Spatially Balanced Sampling of Landbird Populations (contact Jennifer Timmer to request a copy.",

    "section": "6.4 Data Analysis",
    "text": "6.4 Data Analysis\n\nFramework and terminology\nWe implemented a unified framework for data analysis and estimation of abundance, density, occupancy, and their respective trends. Hereafter, we refer to abundance, density, and occupancy as “primary population parameters”, or simply “population parameters”, and estimates of these parameters as “population estimates”. Abundance is the number of species members present within a specified areal unit and time frame. Density is abundance per unit area (birds per \\(km^2\\)). Occupancy is the probability or proportion of sampling units within an areal unit and time frame where at least one species member is present. Because population estimates are derived from data collected over 6-min surveys conducted once per sampling period (i.e., the breeding season), the time frame of estimation is 6 minutes. Thus, IMBCR abundance and occupancy estimates quantify the number of individuals present and the proportion of sampling units (or area) with \\(\\geq1\\) individual present, respectively, within a 6 minute snapshot in time. In contrast, other monitoring programs that estimate population parameters over longer time frames that allow movement into the sampling unit during the sampling period will tend to quantify the distribution of breeding territories or home ranges (i.e., space use; for further details, see Section D.1.6 in Appendix D).\nGiven our sampling design (see above), the fundamental areal unit of estimation for all parameters is the stratum, and so our models estimate abundance, density, and occupancy for all strata making up the IMBCR programmatic footprint. Additionally, our design allows us to derive population estimates for larger areal units consisting of \\(\\geq2\\) strata (hereafter superstrata) by summarizing across component strata. For density and occupancy, superstrata estimates represent means of component strata weighted by their area. For abundance, we simply sum component strata estimates to derive superstrata estimates. Hereafter, we use the term “areal units” to refer to strata and superstrata in general. To allow flexible trend estimation for any areal unit and time period, trend estimation involves post hoc analysis of annual population estimates generated by a primary estimation model (Appendix D). Finally, analyzing data in a manner consistent with the IMBCR design, we leverage all available information across the IMBCR program to estimate parameters representing the observation process, which by extension improves precision of population estimates.\nUnder this framework, we preferentially analyzed data using a hurdle model, which integrates estimation of abundance and occupancy. For ~10% of species for which hurdle model(s) failed to meet a priori criteria for convergence and sampling within a reasonable time frame (described further below), we estimated abundance and occupancy in separate models. We describe in detail the structure of these models (hurdle, abundance, and occupancy) in Appendix D.\n\n\nData filtering\nWe set minimum data thresholds applied to each species for estimating population parameters. We estimated abundance for all species with \\(\\geq 30\\) detections recorded across the IMBCR program. For species with 10-29 detections, we estimated occupancy using occupancy models. For species with fewer detections, we did not attempt to estimate any population parameters. These criteria were applied after excluding the furthest 10% of detections following standard practice for distance sampling (see Section D.1.6 in Appendix D). Thus, in practice, the minimum number of detections required was 33 for estimating abundance.\nFor each species, we only analyzed data from strata where the species was detected at least once during at least one year. We thus conditioned strata-level estimation on the species having been detected at least once, thereby (conservatively) excluding strata outside the range of the species. When rolling up strata to superstrata estimates, we assumed surveyed strata that were thus excluded from primary strata-level estimation to have density and occupancy estimates of zero.\n\n\nModel Assumptions\nDistance sampling theory was developed to account for the decreasing probability of perceiving an object of interest (e.g., a bird) with increasing distance from the observer to the object (Buckland et al., 2001). Estimated perceptibility is used to adjust the count of birds to account for birds that were present but not perceived within sampled area. Application of distance theory requires that five critical assumptions be met: 1) all birds at and near the sampling location (distance = 0) are perceived; 2) distances to birds are measured accurately; 3) birds do not move in response to the observer’s presence (Buckland et al., 2001; Thomas et al., 2010); 4) cluster sizes are recorded without error; and 5) the sampling units are representative of the entire survey region (Buckland, Marsden, & Green, 2008).\nStarting in 2023, we added time-removal sampling to account for imperfect availability for perception. Imperfect availability can arise, for example, from birds being hidden from view and quiet during some portion of their daily activities. The addition of removal sampling data (i.e., the time period of detection within the 6 min survey) can be seen as relaxing assumption 1 (Amundson et al. 2016). Regardless, we now account for two components of detection probability, a spatial component accounting for distance from the surveyor and a temporal component accounting for incomplete availability for detection, theoretically improving accuracy of our population estimates over estimates prior to 2023, which only accounted for the former.",

We include details of specific strata or superstrata for which our partners are most interested. However, results from all strata and all biologically meaningful superstrata can be found on the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center 2.0 (RMADC). This online database contains species counts, density, abundance, occupancy, and population trend results per strata, and also interactive maps showing approximate survey and detection locations. Instructions for using the RMADC are included in Appendix A of this report.\n\n\nSpecies names\nUnless otherwise specified, all bird species names listed in this report are from the 63rd supplement to the American Ornithological Society’s Checklist of North American Birds (Chesser et al., 2022).\n\n\nNumber of species with estimates\nThe way we present density and occupancy estimates in the final report has changed from years prior to 2018. In the past, if a species had been detected in a stratum in a previous year, but was not detected in the current year, we did not provide density or occupancy estimates for that species in that stratum. We now include estimates for these species. In these cases, the estimate for a given year is zero or very close to zero. We consider these to be legitimate estimates of zero occupancy or density because the species occurs in the area of interest, but was not detected in a particular year.\nThis change means that the number of species with density or occupancy estimates for a given stratum or superstratum in a given year is not comparable to the number of species with estimates for that stratum or superstratum and year in reports prior to 2018. The number of species in the current report will include species with zero, or near zero estimates, if that species has been detected in previous years, whereas reports before 2018 will not. Therefore, there may be more species with estimates for a given stratum in a final report for 2018 and later.",

    "text": "23.2 Adaptive Management\nMonitoring is integral to the management and conservation of wildlife populations (Marsh & Trenham, 2008; Sauer & Knutson, 2008). In particular, monitoring is a key part of adaptive management, providing the means for assessing the impacts of management changes and improving system understanding (Lyons et al., 2008; Nichols & Williams, 2006). With progression of adaptive management, however, monitoring may also need to adapt to changing management objectives and environmental circumstances. The IMBCR program accommodates the principles of adaptive monitoring (Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009) because it:\n\naddresses well-defined and tractable questions\n\nis underpinned by rigorous science\nis based on a conceptual model of how bird populations function and\n\nis relevant to the management of natural resources (Pavlacky et al., 2017).\n\nUnder the adaptive monitoring framework, the objectives, sampling design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation are iterative, allowing the program to evolve and develop in response to new information or new management questions. The IMBCR program allows for different stratification schemes across states and regions and the re-stratification of local management units to better address partner management objectives or new questions. The flexible hierarchical design also accommodates annual fluctuation of sampling intensity without compromising regional population estimates. In addition, overlay projects can address specific management questions or hypotheses without affecting the integrity of the overall IMBCR framework.",

    "text": "Landscape-scale effects of a grassland restoration program\nDavid Pavlacky and coauthors published a study examining the effect of grassland habitat loss on grassland bird diversity across the western Great Plains, and if and how lands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) offset this loss. They used the “background” IMBCR data from surveys conducted each year to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of habitat loss and restoration on grassland birds. They found that occupancy and species richness of grassland specialists declined with a loss of grassland habitat, but increased with greater CRP in the surrounding landscape. In addition, although species richness of grassland specialists was similar between intact grasslands and landscapes containing CRP, turnover in species composition between the two landscapes suggested that landscapes with CRP lacked complete representation of grassland specialists. Lastly, the predicted effect of adding 1 km2 of CRP to the landscape increased the richness of grassland specialists the most in northern latitudes, like northeastern Montana.

We surveyed birds in a high and low-development stratum within the project area, and also on surrounding land as part of the “background” IMBCR effort, which served as a reference sample. We then estimated population trends in occupancy and species richness relevant to a priori management triggers set by the BLM. Twenty-four species had negative trends in the high-development stratum, including Sage Thrasher, which had a large enough decline to meet a management trigger. Overall species richness also showed a negative trend in the high-development stratum relative to the background and low-development strata, and well pad density was the leading causal factor for observed negative impacts. Read the full publication here.\n\n\nPredicting the effects of pinyon-juniper removal on birds associated with pinyon-juniper and sagebrush habitats\nNick Van Lanen and co-authors used “background” IMBCR data across several western Bird Conservation Regions (BCR) to model population trends and density-habitat relationships for sagebrush-associated, pinyon-juniper (PJ)-associated, and generalist songbird species. They found eight decreasing and 14 increasing regional populations, and in particular, no species were found to be declining within the highest elevation-portion of the study area (the Northern Rockies BCR). Their models also indicated that PJ removal efforts would benefit Sage Thrasher, Brewer’s Sparrow, and Green-tailed Towhee populations, but harm PJ-associated species, like Bewick’s Wren and Gray Flycatcher. Their results, including predicted density maps, can help prioritize species and regions for conservation action and inform management for species with disparate habitat needs.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The availability of consistent monitoring data at multiple scales is an important challenge for avian conservation (Ruth et al., 2003). The IMBCR program meets this challenge through its probabilistic, nested design, which allows for inference to multiple scales of interest, from National Grasslands to states to BCRs (Pavlacky et al., 2017). With this design, we can model habitat relationships to evaluate species’ responses to local management actions and predict species’ distributions for landscape prioritization. Stratification based on eco-regional boundaries and other fixed attributes is also a critical feature of the IMBCR program because it allows for the evaluation of long-term avian responses to landscape and climate change (Metzger et al., 2013; Pavlacky et al., 2017).\nThe importance of long-term population monitoring at larger spatial scales is well known (Jones, 2011; Thompson et al., 1998), but it is often cost-prohibitive. The IMBCR program reduces expenses through cooperation with multiple partners, one of the stated goals of effective collaboration and coordinated bird monitoring (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007), and also through efficiencies in data collection and analyses. Partners can investigate priority species and management questions with slight modifications to the IMBCR design, further reducing costs associated with developing new studies and monitoring programs. These cost savings allow for an increased sampling effort and/or for the development of decision support tools to aid land managers and conservation practitioners on the ground. Based on the spatially balanced design, the IMBCR program can also accommodate a shortage of monitoring funds in certain years or strata without reducing the overall rigor of the program (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004).\nThe IMBCR program is well-positioned to address the conservation and management needs of a wide range of stakeholders due to its rigorous, hierarchical design and the strength of the IMBCR partnership. This partnership is an ongoing collaboration between multiple entities from state and federal agencies to non-governmental organizations and Joint Ventures, and was created to address management and conservation objectives of larger avian programs like NABCI (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). Through the IMBCR partnership, monitoring resources are pooled, creating efficiencies and allowing for inference to larger landscapes (Pavlacky et al., 2017). By providing essential knowledge of bird populations at multiple scales relevant to management and conservation, the IMBCR program informs prioritization of management actions and facilitates a collaborative approach to bird conservation (Ruth et al., 2003, Pavlacky et al., 2017).",

The relevant Stratum or Superstratum will be listed in a callout block like this one.\n\n\n\nGeographic filters\nBird Conservation Region: Selecting this filter will provide you with results for all strata and superstrata within a particular Bird Conservation Region - see Figure 5.1 for a map.\nState: Selecting this filter will supply the user with data and results for all strata and superstrata within a particular state.\nLand Management Agency: This filter will allow users to select data and results for All Other Lands, Colorado State Land Board, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), US Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Department of Defense (DOD), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), US Forest Service (USFS), or National Park Service (NPS).\nStratum: This filter allows users to select data and results for a geographic unit of analysis.\nSuperstratum: This filter allows users to select data and results for multiple strata that were analyzed jointly (e.g., the entire Bridger-Teton National Forest which was broken up into 2 strata, or the entire state of Colorado which was broken up into 30 strata).\n\n\nOther filters\nBaseline (IMBCR) or Overlay (GRTS): “Baseline” surveys are standard IMBCR surveys which contribute to statewide and regional estimates. These surveys are drawn from a spatially-balanced random sample of a given geographic extent (e.g. a National Forest or BLM Field Office). These surveys are designed to monitor broadly across many species and habitat types.\n“Overlay” surveys are projects designed to answer a specific question, or monitor a specific subset of species or habitats. These surveys may be stratified by elevation, soil type, management or project boundaries, disturbance, etc. Some examples include projects designed to assess bird response to varying levels of impacts such as human recreation on heavily-used trails, oil & gas infrastructure, and grassland reseeding.\nSpecies: This filter allows users to select data and results for a particular species.\nYear: This filter will allow users to select all data and results for a particular year.",

This was done to facilitate improved tracking of priority species on BLM lands throughout Colorado. Rio Grande National Forest and White River National Forest strata were each split into three strata: low, medium, and high elevations. This stratification by elevation allowed sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the forests. The Routt National Forest and Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests strata were reorganized and a third stratum, the Williams Fork Area, was created from the two because it had mixed administration between the Routt National Forest and the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forests.\nThe RMNW stratum was re-stratified to accurately reflect land ownership. There was a land acquisition within Great Sand Dunes National Monument and some samples were removed from Rio Grande National Forest and added to the RMNW stratum; 16 km² were added to the area of the RMNW strata. In South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest stratum was split into two strata based on watersheds in the Forest: Hydrologic Code 7 Watersheds and all other watersheds.

    "text": "2013\n2013 brought significant changes to the program’s overall stratification methods. The original IMBCR sampling grids were created at the state scale and as the program expanded, additional sampling grids were created at the BCR scale. In response to a rapidly growing monitoring program, the partnership acknowledged the need for a standard national grid system to promote the coordination and application of monitoring data in conservation. The group proposed the use of the United States National Grid (USNG), a national grid system created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, as its standard. There are three advantages to using the USNG. First, the use of standard grids allows for the integration of datasets and subsequent identification of areas where sampling should or has not occurred. Second, it provides a means to identify sampled areas in a consistent manner so results of monitoring projects can be evaluated in a spatially comparable way. Lastly, it facilitates regional and national-level avian distribution modeling and the development of broad-scale avian distribution maps. This standard was approved by the NABCI committee. Bird Conservancy started using the USNG for new stratification and re-stratification schemes in 2013.\nWe added several USFS strata to the sampling frame for the 2013 field season – Coronado National Forest in southern Arizona, Carson National Forest in north-central New Mexico, and Caribou-Targhee National Forest in southeastern Idaho. Coronado and Carson National Forests were stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Because Caribou-Targhee National Forest spans three states and three BCRs, it was necessary to divide the forest into four strata. The state and BCR-level stratification distinctions allowed the summation of the data for individual states or BCRs. The four new strata in Idaho and Utah join a preexisting Caribou-Targhee stratum in west-central Wyoming as a part of Wyoming’s statewide effort. In addition, Pawnee National Grassland was split into two strata – public lands and private lands – since Pawnee National Grassland contains a large amount of private land within its administrative boundary. This allowed the USFS to concentrate more survey effort specifically on public lands. In Wyoming, the preexisting stratum in BCR 10 containing all USFS Region 4 lands (other than Bridger-Teton National Forest) was re-stratified into three separate strata, one for each Forest (Caribou-Targhee, Ashley, and Wasatch). This allows for forest-wide estimates within Caribou-Targhee National Forest. If, in the future, Ashley and Wasatch National Forests are completely sampled, this will also allow for forest-wide estimates in each of those forests.\nThe North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska portions of BCR 17 underwent a complete re-stratification to incorporate several NPS Northern Great Plains Inventory and Monitoring Network (NGPN) strata. All of the non-NPS strata in these states were retained, but renamed to avoid confusion. The NPS strata were stratified by NPS unit to allow the NGPN to monitor birds on each of its units separately. New strata included Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Badlands National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Mount Rushmore National Monument, and Wind Cave National Park.\nNebraska BCR 18 also underwent a complete re-stratification to allow for the individual stratification of Agate Fossil Beds and Scotts Bluff National Monuments. We also added an additional stratum for Cherry Ranch, a property owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC).",

    "text": "2014\nIn Colorado, the Arapaho and Roosevelt and the Pike and San Isabel National Forests were re-stratified to allow these forests to monitor treatments intended to mitigate fire hazard and improve forest health. We divided each forest into two strata: a control stratum and the remainder of the forest. The control portion of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests consists of lands ranging in elevation from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,000 ft. (2,743 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. The Pike and San Isabel control stratum ranges from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,500 ft. (2,896 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. We created a single experiment overlay stratum for all of Arapaho and Roosevelt and Pike and San Isabel National Forests consisting of actual treatment areas (areas with &gt;30% treatment). Since this stratum spans multiple forests, it is not considered to be a part of the IMBCR design; however, detections from this stratum do contribute to the number of detections used in analyses.\nSignificant stratification changes were made to the BCR 10 portion of Idaho. The four strata defined in the 2012 field season were further subdivided into nine strata. The boundary between USFS Regions 1 and 4 runs through Idaho and was taken into account when re-stratifying so that estimates could be generated at the USFS Region level. The new strata created in Idaho BCR 10 include the “Idaho portion of Bitterroot National Forest”, “BLM Lands within Idaho BCR10”, “Boise National Forest”, “the Idaho portion of Kootenai National Forest”, “Payette National Forest”, “Salmon-Challis National Forest”, “Sawtooth National Forest”, “All other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 1” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries) and “All Other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 4” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries). Since Bitterroot and Kootenai National Forests span Idaho and Montana, 2014 density and occupancy estimates for those forests included strata from both states. In the past, “forest-wide” estimates have only represented the Montana portion of these forests.\nWe subdivided the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) strata in Montana BCRs 11 and 17 to allow density and occupancy estimation specifically within the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Previously, we grouped all USFWS lands together in these BCRs, limiting estimates for individual refuges. In each BCR, we created two new strata – a Charles M. Russel NWR stratum and an “All Other USFWS Lands” stratum.\nIn addition to re-stratification, we added a few new strata to the IMBCR program in 2014. In Nebraska, NGPN began monitoring on the Niobrara National Scenic River spanning BCRs 17 and 19. In Utah, we created a new stratum for Manti-La Sal National Forest. Previously, only the Colorado portion of Manti-La Sal was stratified and surveyed. The additional Utah portion allows for the generation of forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal.",

This DoD installation-level stratification allows for the generation of density and occupancy estimates for each installation. Fort Carson and Piñon Canyon were further stratified by areas within range fans (training zones) and areas outside of range fans to allow the DoD to assess the effects of military training on bird species.\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge stratum also came out of the 2015 re-stratification. During WWII, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, as it was originally known, was a chemical weapons manufacturing facility. At the time of the 2008 IMBCR stratification in the state Colorado, it was still partially owned by the US Army and was included in the DoD stratum. The refuge is now in its own individual stratum.\nThe IMBCR program expanded to include the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR), part of the NPS NGPN in Nebraska and South Dakota. There are two strata for MNRR representing the 39 Mile District and the 59 Mile District. In Utah, an additional stratum was added for Sanpitch Recreation Area. This area is part of Uinta National Forest but administered by Manti-La Sal National Forest and will be incorporated into forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal National.",

    "text": "2016\nIn 2016, the Playa Lakes Joint Venture (PLJV) coordinated a partnership between several state wildlife agencies and Bird Conservancy to expand sampling in five of the joint venture’s six states: Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. PLJV’s sixth state, Colorado, was already included in the IMBCR program starting in 2008. This expansion now provides the program with nearly complete coverage of two BCRs that were only sparsely covered in past years: Shortgrass Prairie (BCR 18) and Central Mixed Grass Prairie (BCR 19). The BCR 18 and 19 portions of these 5 states were divided into several strata, including, playas, rivers, biologically unique landscapes in Nebraska, and all other lands.\nThe IMBCR program also underwent a major expansion into the state of Utah in 2016. The entire state was stratified into BLM, USFS, DoD, and All Other Lands strata. This year was somewhat of a pilot year, with select BLM, USFS, DoD, and all other lands strata sampled across the state. In future years, sampling will be increased to a statewide level.\nIn addition to new strata, some existing strata were re-stratified for a variety of reasons. In North and South Dakota, we re-stratified the Tribal and All Other Lands strata to ensure all tribal lands were only included in the tribal lands strata. In the past, some tribal lands could still be found within the All Other Lands strata. We also re-stratified Cimarron, Kiowa, and Rita Blanca National Grasslands in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. With the expansion of IMBCR throughout the PLJV region, these strata needed to be fit to the US National Grid to make them consistent with the rest of the IMBCR program in the region. In addition, we determined that the portion of Rita Blanca National Grassland that fell in New Mexico was actually managed by Kiowa National Grassland, so that portion was moved to the Kiowa National Grasslands stratum. All DoD lands in Colorado BCR18 were combined into one stratum. This was the same stratification used prior to 2015.",

    "text": "2010\nBeginning in 2010, the point count duration was increased from five minutes to six minutes to facilitate occupancy estimation, which is easier to analyze using equal time intervals (in this case, two minutes each). Observers began recording juvenile birds detected during point counts. Observers placed a “J” in the sex column for these detections. Previously, juvenile birds were not recorded because this study focuses on recording breeding birds. Juvenile bird detections are used for distribution mapping purposes only and are not factored into data analysis. A minute column was added to the bird datasheet so observers could record the actual minute of each bird detection during a point count. Previously, observers used tick marks to separate minute intervals. We added a “visual” checkbox to the bird datasheet for observers to check if they visually observed and identified any of the species recorded. This reminds observers that they need to look for birds in addition to listening for them and helps crew leaders make decisions regarding unusual or rare bird detections while proofing data. We provided observers with an additional datasheet to record the reasons points were not surveyed (e.g., weather issues, unsafe terrain, denied permission by landowner, etc.). This sheet also provided space to record additional landowner information as needed. Lastly, observers began recording horizontal distance to each flyover detection. In the past, we did not record distances because we do not use flyover detections in analysis. However, observers sometimes incorrectly distinguish flyovers from birds using the surrounding habitat while foraging on the wing (e.g., swallows, swifts, and raptors). Therefore, if we find an incorrectly recorded flyover, we can still use the detection data in analysis.",

    "text": "2012\nIn 2012, observers began recording the start time for every point count conducted so we could use temporal information as a variable in analyses. Start times for the entire transect and for individual points were all recorded in Mountain Daylight Time for consistency across the region. Prior to 2012, observers were allowed to conduct point counts until 11:00 AM local time each day. In order to account for variability across study areas from Arizona to Montana, crew leaders instructed observers to survey no later than five hours after sunrise in 2012. Observers also began noting migrant detections on surveys. After the field season, we thoroughly review the migrant records; if those records are verified, they are not included in analysis. Previously, crew leaders instructed observers to record a bird as a male if 1) it was a singing warbler or sparrow, or 2) it was singing repeatedly and emphatically. In 2012, we instructed observers to only identify the sex of a visually observed bird of a sexually dimorphic species. We instructed observers to record subspecies only if they visually identified a bird as such. In the past, we used geographic range to assume a bird was of a particular subspecies. Up until the 2012 field season, we provided observers with a list of rare or difficult to detect species to record while traveling between points within a sampling unit. In 2012, in order to simplify the protocol and collect more useful information, we eliminated the list and observers recorded any species they came across while traveling between points they had not documented during a point count. That way all species encountered within the sampling unit would be documented for distribution mapping purposes.\nAlso in 2012, several changes were made to the vegetation datasheet. First, we removed distance to the nearest road, forest structural stage and human structures from the data sheet. We no longer collect these types of data in the field because they can be obtained through remote sensing. Second, we modified the datasheet to simply record whether a mid-story was present. In the past, if mid-story vegetation was present, observers would record the species found in that layer. Data analysis found mid-story vegetation data to be extremely variable from year to year. Third, we added a ground cover category for residual grass. Finally, we limited acceptable overstory, understory, and ground cover relative abundance values to 1%, 5%, or increments of 10%. In the past, observers estimated cover to the nearest percent for all categories where percent cover or relative abundance was recorded. We made the change to improve the consistency of cover and relative abundance estimates and to decrease the amount of time observers spend estimating these values.\nIn 2012, crew leaders provided observers with two additional data sheets to facilitate working on private lands. The first contained specific information about the land ownership of each point located within a given sampling unit. In cases where a point fell on private property, the data sheet contained the name, contact information and any pertinent notes about the landowner. The second data sheet was a contact log where observers recorded all contacts or attempted contacts they had with landowners. This information was later entered into the landowner database when the observer had internet access.",

The “hurdle” refers to the point-level portion of the state process whereby we assume at least one individual present at each occupied point, and we model the number of additional individuals present over and above the first. Thus, with a hurdle structure zeros can only arise from the occupancy portion of the model, in contrast with zero inflation wherein zeros can arise from either the occupancy or abundance sub-models. By removing the ambiguity of how zeros arise, the hurdle model allows us to more clearly quantify point-level occupancy distinctly from abundance using the same model. Because abundance and occupancy models largely represent subsets of the sub-models contained in the hurdle model, we first describe the hurdle model in complete detail, and then more briefly describe the abundance and occupancy models, focusing on how the latter differ from the former.\n\nState process\nWe model species occupancy of grid cells as\n\\[z_{ijt} \\sim Bernoulli(ψ_{it}) \\tag{D.1}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[logit(ψ_{it}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[ψ],t},SD_{[ψ],t}^{2}), \\tag{D.2}\\]\nwhere \\(ψ_{it}\\) is the probability of species occupancy of a grid cell in stratum \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\), \\(z_{ijt}\\) is the latent occupancy state of grid cell \\(j\\) in stratum \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), and \\(μ_{[ψ],t}\\) and \\(SD_{[ψ],t}^{2}\\) are year-specific mean and variance hyper-parameters. We exclude data for all strata in which the species was never detected (effectively conditioning occupancy on being within the species range).

We subtract 1 from the mean when calculating k and v and add 1 to the random variable to ensure cluster sizes were \\(&gt;1\\). We derive stratum-level density estimates by averaging all \\(D_{ijt}\\) within each stratum, and we take the area-weighted average of strata estimates to obtain superstrata density and occupancy estimates.\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model the sum of observed counts (of independent clusters of individuals) across all points surveyed within a grid cell (\\(n_{ijtl}\\)) and the number of points where the species was detected (\\(y_{ijtl}\\)) as\n\\[n_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(N_{ijt},p_{[a],tl}×p_{[p],t}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr), \\tag{D.11}\\]\n\\[y_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(u_{ijt},p_{[s],tl}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr),~\\mathrm{and} \\tag{D.12}\\]\n\\[p_{[s],tl}=1-(1-p_{[a],tl}×p_{[p],t})^{N_{ijt}}, \\tag{D.13}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[a],tl}\\) is a year- and BCR-specific availability component of detection probability, \\(p_{[p],t}\\) is a year-specific perceptibility component of detection probability, \\(K_{[s],ijt}⁄K\\) is survey effort, and \\(p_{[s],tl}\\) is the probability of detecting the species at an occupied point.

Cell probabilities for availability assume constant availability across the survey period,\n\\[π_{[a],trl}=p_{[ar],tl} (1-p_{[ar],tl})^{r-1}, \\tag{D.18}\\]\nand are scaled to sum to 1,\n\\[π_{[a],trl}^{[c]}=π_{[a],trl}⁄p_{[a],tl}, \\tag{D.19}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[ar],tl}\\) is the availability for a single 2-min time removal bin. Surveys in 2008-2009 were 5 min instead of 6 min in length, so for these years, we calculate the availability for a 1-min interval, \\(p_{[a1],tl}=1-\\biggl((1-p_{[ar],tl})^3\\biggr)^{1/6}\\), and then calculate the unscaled cell probability for the third (1 min) period as \\(π_{[a],(t≤2)(r=3)l}=p_{[a1],tl}×(1-p_{[ar],tl})^{r-1}\\). Cell probabilities for perceptibility account for area of bins with increasing distance:\n\\[π_{[p],td}=\\frac{p_{[pd],td}A_d}{∑_{d=1}^{d_{[max]}}A_d},~\\mathrm{and} \\tag{D.20}\\]\n\\[π_{[p],td}^{[c]}=π_{[p],td}⁄p_{[p],t}, \\tag{D.21}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) is the perceptibility within distance bin \\(d\\) in year \\(t\\), and \\(A_d\\) is the area of distance bin \\(d\\). We model \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) using one of four possible perceptibility models: 1) a half-normal constant model, 2) a hazard rate constant model, 3) a half-normal year model, and 4) a hazard rate year model. For half-normal functions, we calculated $p_{[pd],td} for each distance class as:\n\\[p_{[pd],td}=\\frac{2\\pi\\int_{c=d_{[low]}}^{c=d_{[high]}}exp\\biggl(-\\biggl(\\frac{c^2}{2\\sigma_{t^2}}\\biggr)\\biggr)c~dc}{A_d}, \\tag{D.22}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{[low]}\\) and \\(d_{[high]}\\) are the bounds for distance bin \\(d\\) and \\(σ_t\\) is the half-normal shape parameter. Because of the lack of an analytical solution to the integral of the hazard rate function, we calculated \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) at the midpoint, \\(d_{[mid]}\\), of each distance class:\n\\[p_{[pd],td}=1-exp\\biggl(-\\biggl(\\frac{d_{[mid]}}{h_t}\\biggr)^b\\biggr), \\tag{D.23}\\]\nwhere \\(h_t\\) and \\(b\\) are estimated parameters for the hazard function. For perceptibility models (Equation D.22 and Equation D.23), we draw year-specific shape parameters from hyperdistributions:\n\\[log(σ_t) \\sim Normal(μ_{[σ]},SD_{[σ]}^2), \\tag{D.24}\\]\n\\[log(h_t) \\sim Normal(μ_{[h]},SD_{[h]}^2). \\tag{D.25}\\]\nWe also consider models allowing availability to vary by year and BCR:\n\\[logit(p_{[ar],tl}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[p_{ar}]},SD_{[p_{ar}]}^2). \\tag{D.26}\\]\nPriors for annual variation in detectability components are\n\\[μ_{[σ]} \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5), \\tag{D.27}\\]\n\\[μ_{[h]} \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5), \\tag{D.28}\\]\n\\[μ_{[p_{ar}]} \\sim Normal(0,1), \\tag{D.29}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[SD_{[σ]},SD_{[h]},SD_{[p_{ar}]} \\sim gamma(1,1). \\tag{D.30}\\]\n\n\n\nAbundance-only model\nFor species that we modeled abundance separately from occupancy, we describe here the abundance model, focusing on the model components that differed from the hurdle model.\n\nState process\nWe model species occupancy of grid cells in the same manner as for the hurdle model (Equation D.1 and Equation D.2). Because we model occupancy separately (see Section D.1.4 below), we omit Equation D.3 and Equation D.4 from the abundance model. Without point occupancy, we model abundance at occupied grid cells (in contrast with Equation D.5) more simply as\n\\[N_{ijt} \\sim Poisson(λ_{ijt}×z_{ijt}), \\tag{D.31}\\]\nwith variability among strata and grid cells modeled the same (Equation D.6, Equation D.7, and Equation D.8). Derivation of density, D, also does not change (Equation D.9, Equation D.10).\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model the sum of observed counts in the same manner as the hurdle model (Equation D.11), but we omit observation models for point occupancy (i.e., omit Equation D.12 and Equation D.13). The remaining observation sub-models exactly match those of the hurdle model (Equation D.14 - Equation D.30).\n\n\n\nOccupancy-only model\nFor species that we modeled occupancy separately from abundance, we describe here the occupancy model, focusing on the model components that differed from the hurdle model.\n\nState process\nWe model species occupancy of grid cells and points in the same manner as for the hurdle model (Equation D.1 - Equation D.4). The remainder of the ecological portion of the hurdle model (Equation D.5 - Equation D.10) are ommitted from the occupancy model.\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model species detections at points using\n\\[y_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(u_{ijt},p_{tl}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr), \\tag{D.32}\\]\nwith \\(p_{tl}\\) here being equivalent to \\(p_{[s],tl}\\) in Equation D.12. Overall species detectability for a point survey, \\(p_{tl}\\), summarizes the probability vector\n\\[p_{tl}=∑_{r=1}^{R} \\mathbf{π_{[R],tl}^{[c]}} \\tag{D.33}\\]\nconsisting of multinomial cell probabilities for\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[R],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(y_{ijtl}, \\mathbf{π_{[R],tl}^{[c]}} \\biggr), \\tag{D.34}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{y_{[R],ijt}}\\) is a vector of representing the frequency of points where the species was detected across time removal bins when first detected. Cell probabilities for the time removal model assume constant detectability across the survey period,\n\\[π_{[R],trl}=p_{[R],tl} (1-p_{[R],tl})^{r-1}, \\tag{D.35}\\]\nand are scaled to sum to 1,\n\\[π_{[R],trl}^{[c]}=π_{[R],trl}⁄p_{tl}, \\tag{D.36}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[R],tl}\\) is species detectability for a single 2-min time removal bin. We model variability in species detectability here (\\(p_{[R],tl}\\)) in the same manner as the availability component of the hurdle model (\\(p_{[ar]}\\) in Equation D.26, Equation D.29, and Equation D.30), including the shorter 5-min survey period in 2008-2009 (see explanation following Equation D.19).\n\n\n\nTrend estimation\nWe derived posterior estimates of occupancy and abundance trends for any strata or superstrata for desired time periods from strata or (rolled-up) superstrata estimates of occupancy or density, respectively. For stratum or superstratum, i, we fitted a generalized linear model (GLM) to each posterior sample, m, of density or occupancy estimates:\n\\[log(\\hat{D}_{itm}) \\sim α_{[D],im}+r_{[D],im}×(t-1)~\\mathrm{or} \\tag{D.37}\\]\n\\[logit(\\hat{ψ}_{itm}×\\hat{θ}_{it}) \\sim α_{[ψθ],im}+r_{[ψθ],im}×(t-1). \\tag{D.38}\\]\nFor occupancy, we multiplied \\(ψ×θ\\) to derive the unconditional probability of a point being occupied by the species, and then derived trends. To correctly propagate GLM estimation uncertainty, we sampled a random intercept \\(\\tilde{α}_{im}\\) and slope \\(\\tilde{r}_{im}\\) from the mean and standard error estimated for these parameters for each posterior sample. We then summarized across \\(m\\) to derive the posterior estimates for \\(r\\) and predicted \\(D\\) and \\(ψ×θ\\).\n\n\nPlot size\nFollowing established practice for distance sampling data (Buckland et al. 2001:15, 151), we truncated detections for each species beyond the 90% quantile of recorded distances from the surveyor. The purpose of this practice is to improve the fit of the perceptibility curve by minimizing the influence of outliers on estimation (e.g., \\(p_{[p],tl}\\) in Equation D.15). In our unified framework, truncation sets the plot size for estimation of density and occupancy. Because density is abundance scaled by area, interpretation of density does not depend on plot size, but interpretation of occupancy requires consideration of plot size depending on desired interpretation.\nOccupancy describes the proportion of plots where at least one member of the species occurs (i.e., presence-absence of the species). As such, occupancy can be multipled by stratum area to estimate the area occupied, and plot size is the resolution for this quantity. For species with a plot size &lt; 125m radius (i.e., the maximum plot size whereby neighboring plots within a grid cell do not overlap), estimation of area occupied is readily interpretable as the species range within the stratum. For plot sizes &gt; 125m radius, neighboring plots can overlap, so a single individual can potentially occupy &gt; 1 plot. Thus, for species with plot radii &gt; 125m, area occupied is less readily interpretable as the species range and instead more clearly quantifies space use (Latif et al. 2016). Because of the difference in plot size among species, occupancy estimates are not entirely comparable across species. Nevertheless, large differences in occupancy should be ecologically meaningful. Moreover, application of estimates for quantifying the proportion or area of a stratum occupied would be comparable across species with plot sizes &lt; 125m radius and roughly comparable across species with larger plot sizes. Trends in occupancy will also be comparable across species regardless of plot size. Additionally, trends in occupancy can be more clearly interpretable as changes in species range regardless of plot size, whereas trends in abundance may primarily reflect changes in population size.\n\n\nModel selection\nFor each species, we considered a series of alternative model structures in order to balance model fit, complexity, and computational efficiency. Reflecting the estimation objectives for the analysis, the ecological component of all models shared the same structure, but varied in complexity of the observation process model. Because accounting for heterogeneity in bird observability is critical for accurate population estimation, we aimed to fit maximally complex observation models supported by the data. Moreover, because corrections to count data generated from distance sampling are relatively robust to heterogeneity (see pooling robustness in BUckland et al. 2001:41-42), we prioritized allowing heterogeneity in availability over perceptibility.\nWe first considered two potential functions for describing the decline in perceptibility of birds with distance from the surveyor: a half-normal model and a hazard model. We preliminarily fitted detection-only versions of these models to the raw distance data (i.e., distances not indexed by sampling unit or year). We used the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC; Watanabe 2010, Hooten and Hobbs 2015) to select the most parsimonious perceptibility functional form and then retained that function for each species for modeling distance-based perceptibility in the primary analysis.\nFor primary analysis of data for each species, we first considered the maximally complex hurdle model (hereafter global hurdle model), which included annual variation in both perceptibility and availability, and variability in availability among Bird Conservation Regions (Equation D.24 - Equation D.26). If the global hurdle model did not converge after a specified number of attempts (for details on model fitting, convergence, and MCMC sampling criteria, see Section D.1.8 below), we then considered a constant perceptibility hurdle model, which replaced either Equation D.24 and Equation D.27 or Equation D.25 and Equation D.28 with\n\\[log(σ) \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5) \\tag{D.39}\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[log(h) \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5), \\tag{D.40}\\]\nrespectively. If a constant perceptibility model also failed to converge, we switched to a global abundance model. We allowed for simpler models (i.e., a constant-perceptiblity abundance model and constant-availability hurdle and abundance models), but we only resorted to the global abundance model for 2% of species, and did not need anything simpler to estimate abundance for any species.\nWhen estimating abundance with the abundance model, we estimated occupancy with occupancy models. As with abundance models, we were always able to meet convergence and sampling criteria with a global occupancy model (i.e., detectability varied among years and Bird Conservation Regions as in Equation D.26), so we never needed a constant detectability model.\n\n\nModel fitting\nWe performed all data processing, analysis, and derivation of estimates in R (R Core Team, 2023) and model fitting in Nimble (de Valpine et al. 2017, 2023). All scripts for the annual analysis are maintained in a git repository and available upon request.\nThe R code automated combining strata-level population and trend estimates to derive superstrata estimates at multiple spatial scales, including quantification of estimation uncertainty. Additionally, we automated periodic checking of convergence and switching to alternative models in cases where more complex models failed to converge within a specified number of attempts.\nModel fitting with Nimble entailed sampling model parameter space with 2 independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains. For each species, the automated process began sampling with chains of length = 10000 iterations, discarding the first 5000 as burn-in and retaining every 50th sample, then checked convergence of chains using the \\(\\hat{R}\\) metric and effective sample size using \\(n_{effective}\\) (Gelman et al. 2004). We required \\(\\hat{R}&lt;1.1\\) and \\(n_{effective}\\geq 10\\), and continued sampling for another 10000 iterations until we either achieved these criteria or reached the maximum number of attempts, with an attempt being 10000 iterations and checks of \\(\\hat{R}\\) and \\(n_{effective}\\) occurring after each attempt. We specified a lower max attempts for the global hurdle and abundance models and a higher max attempts for the constant-perceptibility hurdle model. Initially, these levels were 10 and 20 attempts, respectively. For subsequent analyses implemented to troubleshoot errors for some species, we set max attempts higher to 20 and 50, respectively. Going forward, we may further tune the number of attempts, max \\(\\hat{R}\\), and min \\(n_{effective}\\) to balance estimation rigor with computation speed and efficiency.",
